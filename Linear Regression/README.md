# Linear Regression Algoritm #

Algorithm will filter outliers, compute the linear regression of the new set of points, and compute the corresponding R^2 value 

INPUTS 
 * x= x-values for our data set
 * y= y-values for our data set

OUTPUTS
 * fX: x-values with outliers removed
 * fY: y-values with outliers removed
 * slope: slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
 * intercept: intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
 * Rsquared: R^2, a.k.a. coefficient of determination
