# Matrix Algorithm # 

Creates a special matrix where the value of each element in the first row is the number of the column, the value of each element in the first column is the number of the row, and the rest of the elements each has a value equal to the sum of the elements above it and the element to the left. This is dont by simple addition and matrix addressing. 

INPUTS 
* n= the number of rows 
* m= the number of columns

OUTPUTS
* an n x m matrix
