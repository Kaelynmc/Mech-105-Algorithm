# Simpson's 1/3 Algorithm #

Used to integrate using the Simpson's 1/3 rule. In the case of only 2 sections, the trapezoidal rule will be implemented.
In the case of odd intervals, the trapezoidal rule is used on the last two. 

INPUTS 
 * x = the vector of equally spaced independent variable
 * y = the vector of function values with respect to x

OUTPUTS
 * I = the numerical integral calculated
